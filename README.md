# rl_example
simple RL problem to demonstrate algorithm and structure. Problem is a sorting problem where the agent takes in a random object that can be any of 5 different classes. The agent then has to sort them correctly. Eventually, once the agent learns how to sort, the program breaks and shows the final model weights. Weights can be read in via the input.txt file, but are originally just initialized to zero. Policy simply gives +1 to accurate action and -1 to wrong action. This problem is small enough that the world and action space is reflected via 25 <state,action> pairs that the program represents with a 1-D vector.
