# rl_example
simple RL problem to demonstrate algorithm and structure. Problem is a sorting problem where the agent takes in a random object that can be any of 5 different classes. The agent then has to sort them correctly. Eventually once the agent learns how to sort the program breaks and should the final model weights.
